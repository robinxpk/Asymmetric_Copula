@Group
- Which other methods than the ones I thought of would we like to apply?
hypothesis test to test for significant differences due to slope?


@Henri: 
- Does that sound sufficient of a workload for this paper? 
- How much are we supposed to dive into mathematics? 
- In the paper, they identify the marginal distributions and even give the formula of the 
density. This is super useless imo. 
	Can we have an appendix where I put the densities? I mean, the density forumla 
	itself is not relevant at all, right? 
- Two ideas: 
1) Give theory and simulation to check behavior of goodness of fit measures on 
FNACs and then see them applied to real data
2) Give theory on Vine copulas and maybe also include another variables to make 
the model more complex and check how vine copula handle more complexity better?
(Aparently they are more flexible?)
BUT: How useful are Vine copulas (high flexibility) if we only consider trivariate anyway
--> Vine copulas allow to represent all d(d-1)/2 relationships I think 
Simulate using Vine and check how nested copula performs vs vine? 
(( 3) mixed copulas?)

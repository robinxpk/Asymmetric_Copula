- Critique on Flood definition; Can answer with the correlation plots and maybe some examples where it worked really well and where it worked badly. But due to number of stations we had, we used that solution
- We considered discharge quantiles to define beginning and end of flood event. Why not fixed as in  paper? 
Also, paper has this plot for varying thresholds and how correlation behaves. Did you also consider that? 
    > @us: Yes --> show plot, discuss our approach and show good / bad hydrograph fit
- Could you again go into how the u values are obtained from the observed value (re-explain PIT)
- Reason to draw family type etc randomly: Saves a bunch of for-loops when implementing and due to large number of iterations, fraction will tend towards selection probability. i.e. Equally selection of combinations
- In case I do not put tau estimates for AC given NAC into PP, ask if we could reproduce the paper's AC NAC ratio
    ("You applied this to NAC vs Vines, paper mentions this ratio, could you reproduce it?)
- Save too much for slides. Put some into backup
